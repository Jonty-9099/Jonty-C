          Technology is reshaping how pharmacists work day to day. Automation
          handles repetitive dispensing tasks while AI surfaces potential drug
          interactions faster than a human ever could.
        </p>
        <h2 className="mt-8 text-2xl font-bold">Opportunities Ahead</h2>
        <p>
          By embracing digital tools, pharmacies free up staff to focus on
          direct patient education and quality care. Expect to see more remote
          consultations and smart refill reminders in the near future.

          "Automation should augment pharmacists, not replace them."
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          The transition won&apos;t always be smooth, but teams that iterate early
          will build healthier operations for everyone involved.

        <p>
          Virtual care isn&apos;t just a pandemic trendâ€”it&apos;s a fundamental shift in
          how we approach patient engagement. The convenience of video visits
          keeps more people on track with follow ups and routine screenings.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, building trust in a digital setting requires thoughtful design
          and clear communication. Strong provider-patient relationships remain
          the cornerstone of great health outcomes.

          Human-centered design methods help uncover hidden pain points within
          clinical workflows. By prototyping early and often, teams discover
          elegant solutions that truly serve clinicians and patients alike.

          Powerful algorithms can surface treatment recommendations within
          seconds. Yet clinicians must understand how those models are built and
          whether any biases lurk in the training data.
        </p>

          Transparency and ongoing monitoring are key to keeping AI a helpful
          partner instead of a risky black box.
